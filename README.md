# File Registry

A Python-based file registry system for cataloging and searching files across storage locations with metadata and AI analysis capabilities.

## Overview

File Registry helps you build and maintain a central database of file information across your storage volumes. It indexes file metadata including paths, names, sizes, and MD5 hashes, enabling fast searches and analysis across distributed storage systems.

### Key Features

- **Fast File Search**: Quickly locate files by name, path, or hash across multiple storage units and servers
- **MD5 Hash Computation**: Generate and store MD5 hashes for file integrity and duplicate detection
- **Metadata Framework**: Extensible system for adding custom metadata and AI-generated metadata to files
- **Large-Scale Support**: Optimized for handling millions of files across distributed storage
- **Configurable Scanning**: Control which directories and file types to include/exclude from scanning

## Use Cases

- **Content Management**: Find and organize files across multiple storage locations
- **Data Preparation**: Catalog and prepare data for AI analysis and machine learning
- **Storage Optimization**: Identify duplicates and analyze storage patterns 
- **Digital Asset Management**: Track and manage large collections of digital assets

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GameFusion/file-registry.git
cd file-registry

# Install required packages
pip install mysql-connector-python

# Run the setup script to configure your environment
python setup.py
```

The setup script will guide you through:
1. Creating necessary configuration files
2. Setting up database connection credentials
3. Creating database tables
4. Configuring excluded files and directories

## Configuration

The system uses JSON configuration files (stored in the `config` directory):

1. `credentials.json` - Database connection details
2. `excluded_files.json` - Files to exclude from scanning
3. `excluded_dirs.json` - Directories to exclude from scanning

These files are created automatically by the setup script, but can be modified manually as needed.

## Usage

### Scanning Files

```bash
python file_registry_scan.py /path/to/scan
```

### Searching Files

```bash
python file_registry_search.py "search_term"
```

### Viewing Logs

```bash
python file_registry_log.py
```

### MD5 Metadata Scanner

```bash
python md5_metadata_scanner.py /path/to/scan
```

## Project Structure

- `file_registry_scan.py` - Main script for scanning and adding files to the database
- `file_registry_search.py` - Search for files in the database registry
- `file_registry_log.py` - Display log information
- `md5_metadata_scanner.py` - Compute and store MD5 hashes for files

## Performance Optimizations

The system includes several optimizations for handling large file systems:
- Caching mechanism to speed up repeated operations
- Exclusion of system directories like `.snapshot`, `.git`, and `.gitold`
- Connection validation to ensure database reliability
- Warm-up phase optimization for faster startup
